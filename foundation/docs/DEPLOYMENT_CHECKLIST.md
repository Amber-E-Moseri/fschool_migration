## 3) Rollback Steps
1. Revert Netlify site to the previous successful deploy.
2. Re-deploy prior Edge Function versions:
   - `supabase functions deploy <function-name>@<previous-version>` (or redeploy from previous commit).
3. If recent schema migrations caused breakage:
   - Apply a forward fix migration (preferred), or restore DB from maintenance backup.
4. Restore prior `netlify.toml` and `_headers` from previous commit and redeploy.
5. Re-run smoke checks: login, registration, admin, teacher, system health.
